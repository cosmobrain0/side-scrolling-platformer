# Side Scrolling Platformer
an endless 2D side scrolling platformer where you have to kill enemies and navigate around obstacles.

## TODO List:
- player animations (it needs to look a little squishy like a slime or water drop or something)
- player shooting
- enemies:
  - enemies like goombas which move left and right, and can be shot or jumped on
  - spike enemies which stay still and hurt you, and can't be killed
  - projectile enemies which move like goombas until they see you, in which case they pause and shoot projectiles at regular intervals
- player health system with a healthbar

I'm hoping to finish this by Monday, 2nd September.
